    "highlights": "Why are cricket scoreboards backwards in Australia?ByJonty ColmanBBC Sport journalistPublished21 November 2025Why are cricket scorecards backwards in Australia?On Australian television, cricket scores are presented in the opposite way to what they are in England and most other countries.For example, a score of 200-4 would actually be shown as 4-200, with the wickets taken displayed first instead of the runs.The reason is due to Australian tradition that dates back to the 19th century and a scoreboard designed by former Australian cricketer Ned Gregory.Gregory became the curator of the Sydney Cricket Ground but upon taking the role, decided he did not like the original English scoreboard design and felt it did not give spectators inside the ground enough information.Gregory therefore redesigned a huge scoreboard to include a wide range of information on the match and required at least two operators to manage it.A major design change to that saw the use of wickets before runs on the tota...",

The traditional red ball remains used for Test matches as they stand out in daylight and don't clash with the players' whites White balls were introduced for matches in limited-overs formats, which often take place under floodlights like one-day internationals and T20s. They were developed in the 1970s and first used in the 1992 Cricket World Cup.Pink balls, meanwhile, are designed to provide balanced visibility in formats which transition from daylight to floodlights during play. They were first trialled in the late 2000s and become a staple of international cricket, having been deemed superior to alternative trial options including yellow and orange.What rules must cricket balls abide by?Cricket balls have a cork interior, held together...",

When you look at the number of overs taken to complete the game, it was Test cricket on fast forward.England were well on top at lunch on the second day, 105 ahead with nine wickets in hand. The pitch was still doing plenty. It looked so tough for Australia to get back into the match.From that point, England's shot selection was their big undoing. Scott Boland put in probably his worst performance in an Australia shirt in the first innings, then turned it around in the second to be the catalyst for the comeback.England's batters were out trying to hit balls outside off stump, on the up, through the covers.Trying to score off those deliveries, with those ...",
