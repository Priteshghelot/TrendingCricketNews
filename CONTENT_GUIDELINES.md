# 📝 Content Guidelines for AdSense Approval

To overcome the "Low Value Content" rejection, you need to move away from "Thin Content" towards high-quality, long-form journalism.

## 1. Article Length (The 600-Word Rule)
Google AdSense reviewers want to see substance. 
- **Current Average:** ~40 words (Thin Content)
- **Target:** **600 - 1,000 words** per article.
- **Why?** Longer articles allow you to provide context, history, and analysis that a simple news snippet cannot.

## 2. Content Structure
Don't just write a wall of text. Use a professional structure:
- **Lead Paragraph:** Who, what, when, where, why.
- **Background:** Previous match results, player history, or series context.
- **Key Highlights:** Detailed breakdown of the event.
- **Expert Analysis/Opinion:** What does this mean for the team/tournament?
- **Future Outlook:** What's next? (Next match date, implications).

## 3. Avoid "Low Quality" Signals
- **Clickbait Titles:** Stop using `🚨` and all-caps titles like `🚨 BREAKING NEWS 🚨`. Instead, use descriptive, professional titles like `India's Predicted Playing XI for the 3rd Test in Perth`.
- **Placeholder Thumbnails:** Ensure every post has a high-quality, relevant image.
- **Duplicates:** Do not copy-paste news from other sites. Rewrite it in your own words with your own unique perspective.

## 4. E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust)
We've added the structural pages (About, Editorial Policy), but your content needs to reflect this too:
- Use phrases like "In our analysis...", "Historically, this team...", "Our team observed...".
- Quote official sources (e.g., "According to the BCCI press release...").

## 5. Frequency
- Aim for at least **15-20 high-quality articles** (600+ words each) before you re-apply.
- Post consistently (e.g., 1 solid article per day is better than 10 thin snippets in one day).
